Human movement analysis is entering a new era driven by advances in computer vision and machine learning. Accurate estimation of body pose, shape, motion, forces, and joint dynamics is crucial for translating visual data into meaningful biomechanical insights. Yet, challenges such as data variability, limited annotations, and domain generalization persist. This workshop explores emerging intersection of computer vision and biomechanics, bringing together researchers and practitioners to discuss new methods, datasets, and applications that bridge perception and physical understanding enabling precise, data-driven insights and extending the impact of vision-based biomechanics across diverse domains such as rehabilitation, sports performance, and injury prevention.

## Call for Papers

This workshop will be accepting short papers (4 pages excluding references and appendix). Topics of interest for this workshop include, but are not limited to,

- Computer vision for injury prevention and rehabilitation monitoring
- Computer vision for movement disorder assessment
- Vision-based musculoskeletal modeling and simulation
- Physics informed neural networks for musculoskeletal modeling and simulation
- Predicting ground reaction forces and center of pressure from video data
- Multimodal data fusion: integrating vision with wearable sensors for better biomechanics
- Open datasets, benchmarks, and reproducibility in biomechanical vision research
- Ethics, privacy, and fairness in vision-based biomechanics
- Clinical evaluation metrics and explainable models for computer vision enabled biomechanics
- Privacy preserving approaches to enable computer vision for biomechanical analysis
- Deploying vision-based biomechanics in low-resource settings and on consumer grade devices


Researchers interested in contributing should upload a short paper of up to 4 pages (not counting references and appendices) by _March 15, 2026, 23:59 AoE_. The link for submission will be made available on the January 15, 2026. References and supplementary material can exceed 4 pages.  Please upload a single PDF that includes the main paper and any supplementary material. Submissions that exceed 4 pages or submissions with significant formatting violations will be rejected.

Authors should use the same CVPR LaTeX style provided on the main website [here](https://github.com/cvpr-org/author-kit/archive/refs/tags/CVPR2026-v1(latex).zip). (If clicking on the link does not work, please copy the link and paste in your browser tab). Submissions don't need to be anonymized. The workshop allows submissions of papers that are under review or have been recently published in a conference or a journal. Authors should state any overlapping published work at the time of submission. The workshop will not have any official proceedings, so it is non-archival.

All submissions will be reviewed and will be evaluated on the basis of their technical content. Accepted papers will be selected for either a short oral presentation or spotlight presentation, in addition to a poster presentation.

If you have any questions or difficulty submitting your paper, contact us at [cvbw2026@gmail.com](cvbw2026@gmail.com).
